Across all 11 EUC_2D TSPLIB instances, 2-opt achieved the best (lowest) min and mean tour lengths in every case. Exchange (swap) consistently beat jump (insert) but still trailed 2-opt by a wide margin—especially on large instances (PCB442, PR2392, USA13509). Variance across 30 uniformly random starts was smaller for 2-opt, indicating more robust convergence to high-quality local minima. The main trade-off is runtime: 2-opt’s O(n²) neighborhood is costlier; limiting its search window and capping accepted moves kept the largest instances tractable with minor quality loss. Bottom line: use 2-opt as the baseline local search. Exchange can serve as a quick warm-start, but jump adds little benefit on these benchmarks.
