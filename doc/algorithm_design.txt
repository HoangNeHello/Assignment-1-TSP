---------- ALGORITHM 1 ----------
Simple Genetic Algorithm reproduction cycle with 1-point crossover replaced with ordered crossover, and 
SGA mutation replaced with insert mutation. This adapts the SGA reproduction cycle to a problem represented 
by permutations instead of bitstrings, and can be used as a comparison for other algorithms. 

---------- ALGORITHM 2----------
Small breeding pool selected by Elitism selection, then children bred to fill rest of population size 
using Roulette selection of breeding pool. Children created by PMX crossover and subjected to 
Inversion mutation.

---------- ALGORITHM 3 ----------
