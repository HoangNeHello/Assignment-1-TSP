---------- ALGORITHM 1 ----------
Simple Genetic Algorithm reproduction cycle with 1-point crossover replaced with ordered crossover, and 
SGA mutation replaced with insert mutation. This adapts the SGA reproduction cycle to a problem represented 
by permutations instead of bitstrings, and can be used as a comparison for other algorithms.
