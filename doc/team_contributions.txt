Overview
We designed and implemented a modular TSP library and experiments across seven exercises. 
Work was divided by exercise, with later reallocation due to capacity and availability. 
Exercises 1–5 are complete; Exercises 6–7 are in progress under the adjusted plan below. 
(Request for Extension was accepted)

Contributions to Date
- Hoang — Exercises 1 and 2
  Implemented TSP.py (TSPLIB EUC_2D parsing, distance and tour utilities) and local_search.py (jump/insert, exchange/swap, and 2-opt with performance safeguards). Integrated results logging and analysis.
- Cynthia — Exercise 3
  Implemented tsp_class.py (Individual and Population: O(n) uniform random permutations, fitness evaluation) and validation tests.
- Eileen — Exercise 4
  Implemented mutation operators (insert, swap, inversion) and crossovers (Order, PMX, Cycle, Edge Recombination) in variation.py, plus permutation-safety tests.
- Jiahe — Exercise 5
  Implemented selection methods in tsp_selection.py (fitness-proportionate, tournament, elitism) and statistical sanity tests; improved robustness.
- Markus — Exercise 6 (initial design)
  Drafted evolutionary algorithm designs and benchmarking plan (population sizes, generation budgets, reporting format).
- Liu — Exercise 7 (initial)
  Began Inver-over operator study and baseline implementation plan from the referenced paper.

Reallocation and Current Plan
- Exercise 6 (evolutionary algorithm benchmarking): led by Jiahe, Cynthia, and Markus.
  Finalize three EA variants, run grids with population sizes 20, 50, 100, 200 and generations 2000, 5000, 10000, 20000. Produce results/memetic_ga.txt and design rationale in doc/algorithm_design.txt.
- Exercise 7 (Inver-over algorithm): led by Eileen and Liu.
  Complete Inver-over implementation and 30-run benchmarks. Write results/inverover.txt and results/memetic_ga_inverover_comparison.txt.
- Submission packaging: Hoang.
  Maintain repository structure, verify outputs, and prepare doc/readme.txt.

Communication Notes
- Markus: Late start on Exercise 6 due to not checking group communications, which led to an Extension Request. (Refer to Extension.png)
- Liu: Limited direct communication; updates are relayed via Eileen.
